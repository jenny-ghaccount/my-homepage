# My Homepage (Vercel Fullstack)

A simple Vercel-ready fullstack app to search and display live flight data from the OpenSky Network API.

## Features
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS static site
- Backend: Node.js API route (`/api/flights`) fetches the first 10 flights from OpenSky
- Click "Search Flights" to view the latest flights in a table

## Deployment
- Deploy this project to Vercel (https://vercel.com/)
- The backend API route is in `/api/flights.js`
- The frontend is served from `index.html` and related static files

## Local Development
- Requires Node.js for backend API route (handled by Vercel in production)
- No local Node.js needed for static frontend only
